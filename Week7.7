A number is considered to be ugly if its only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦] is the sequence of ugly numbers.

Task:

complete the function which takes a number n as input and checks if it's an ugly number. return ugly if it is ugly, else return not ugly

Hint:

An ugly number U can be expressed as: U = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b and c are nonnegative integers.



For example:

Test	Result

print(checkUgly(6))	ugly 

print(checkUgly(21))	not ugly 



def checkUgly(n):

    if n<=0:

        return "not ugly"

    if n in [1,2,3,5]:

        return "ugly"

        

    for i in [2,3,5]:

        if n%i==0:

            

            return checkUgly(n//i)

    return "not ugly"

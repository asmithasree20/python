Given a number with maximum of 100 digits as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits.

Input Format:

Take a number in the form of String from stdin.

Output Format:

Print the difference between sum of even and odd digits

Example input:

1453

Output:

1

Explanation:

Here, sum of even digits is 4 + 3 = 7

sum of odd digits is 1 + 5 = 6.

Difference is 1.

Note that we are always taking absolute difference

#sum

def differenceSum(n):

    e=0

    o=0

    s=str(n)

    for i in range(0,len(s)):

        if i%2==0:

            o=o+int(s[i])

        else:

            e=e+int(s[i])

    return (abs(e-o))

Write a program to print all the locations at which a particular element (taken as input) is found in a list and also print the total number of times it occurs in the list. The location starts from 1.



For example, if there are 4 elements in the array:

5

6

5

7



If the element to search is 5 then the output will be:

5 is present at location 1

5 is present at location 3

5 is present 2 times in the array.

Sample Test Cases



Test Case 1

Input



4

5

6

5

7

5



Output



5 is present at location 1.

5 is present at location 3.

5 is present 2 times in the array.

 

Test Case 2

 Input

5

67

80

45

97

100

50



Output

50 is not present in the array.



#Location

n=int(input())

l=[]

for i in range(0,n):

    a=int(input())

    l.append(a)

t=int(input())

n1=l.count(t)

if n1!=0:

    

    for i in range(0,len(l)):

        if l[i]==t:

            print(t," is present at location ",i+1,'.',sep='')

    print(t," is present ",n1," times in the array.",sep='')

else:

    print(t,"is not present in the array.")

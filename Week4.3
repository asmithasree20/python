Write a program that finds whether the given number N is Prime or not. If the number is prime, the program should return 2 else it must return 1.

Assumption: 2 <= N <=5000, where N is the given number.

Example1: if the given number N is 7, the method must return 2

Example2: if the given number N is 10, the method must return 1



For example:

Input	Result

7	2

10	1



num = int(input())

for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

        if num % i == 0:

            print(‘1’)

            break

else:

    print(‘2’)

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.

When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

 



For example:

Input	Result

AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT	AAAAACCCCC

CCCCCAAAAA







#DNA SQUENCE

s=input()

l=len(s)

w=[]

c=0

a=0

b=10

for i in range(0,len(s)-9):

s1=s[a:b]

    if s1 in w and w.count(s1)==1:

        print(s1,end='\n')

    w.append(s1)

    

    a=a+1

    b=b+1

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

Example 1:

Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"

Output: 

1

Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.



For example:

Input	Result

hello world

ad	1













#Keyboard

s1=input()

s=s1.lower()

a=list(input())

z=s.split()

d=0
for i in z:

    c=0

    for j in i:

        if j in a:

            c=1

            break

    if(c==0):

        d=d+1

        

print(d)

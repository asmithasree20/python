Write a program to return the nth number in the fibonacci series. The value of N will be passed to the program as input.

NOTE: Fibonacci series looks like –

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, . . . and so on.

i.e. Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and continues generating the next number as the sum of the previous two numbers.

• first Fibonacci number is 0,

• second Fibonacci number is 1,

• third Fibonacci number is 1,

• fourth Fibonacci number is 2,

• fifth Fibonacci number is 3,

• sixth Fibonacci number is 5,

• seventh Fibonacci number is 8, and so on.



For example:

Input:

7

Output

8

#Fibanocci

n = int(input())

if n == 1:

    print(0)

elif n == 2:

    print(1)

else:

    a, b = 0, 1

    for _ in range(n - 2):

        a, b = b, a + b

    print(b)

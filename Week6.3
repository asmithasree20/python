Two string values S1, S2 are passed as the input. The program must print first N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.

Input Format:



The first line contains S1.

The second line contains S2.

The third line contains N.



Output Format:



The first line contains the N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.



Boundary Conditions:



2 <= N <= 10

2 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000



Example Input/Output 1:



Input:



abcbde

cdefghbb

3



Output:



bcd



Note:



b occurs twice in common but must be printed only once.

for i in s1:

    if i not in l:

for i in range(0,len(l1)):

    if l1[i]>=1 and n>0:

        print(l[i],end='')

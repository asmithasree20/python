Write a python program that takes a integer between 0 and 15 as input and displays the number of '1' s in its binary form.(Hint:use python bitwise operator.

Sample Input

3

Sample Output:

2

Explanation:

The binary representation of 3 is 011, hence there are 2 ones in it. so the output is 2.

For example:

Input	Result

3	2





#binary

n=int(input())

a=bin(n)

s=str(a)

c=0

for i in s:

    if i=='1':

        c=c+1

print(c)
